# Winlogbeat and Sysmon Installation ‚Äì Windows Server and Windows 11

This guide explains how to configure advanced log collection in Windows using Sysmon and Winlogbeat, sending events to the Elastic Stack.

---

## üéØ Objective

Install Sysmon to generate detailed event logs and configure Winlogbeat to collect and forward those logs to Elasticsearch.

---

## üß∞ Requirements

- Windows Server (AD) and Windows 11 Client
- Access to PowerShell as Administrator
- IP and port of your Elastic Stack server
- Downloaded:
  - [Sysmon](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon)
  - [Winlogbeat](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/beats/winlogbeat)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Step 1 ‚Äì Install Sysmon

1. Download `Sysmon.zip` and extract it.
2. Download a recommended config file (e.g., from [SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config](https://github.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config)).
3. Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:

```powershell
.\Sysmon64.exe -accepteula -i sysmonconfig.xml
```

> Replace `sysmonconfig.xml` with the path to your config file.

To verify installation:

```powershell
Get-Service Sysmon
```

## üì¶ Step 2 ‚Äì Install Winlogbeat

1. Download and extract Winlogbeat.
2. Run the PowerShell installer:

```powershell
.\install-service-winlogbeat.ps1
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 3 ‚Äì Configure Winlogbeat to Send Logs

Edit the file `winlogbeat.yml` and update these sections:

### Elasticsearch Output:

```yaml
output.elasticsearch:
  hosts: ["https://<your-elastic-ip>:9200"]
  username: "elastic"
  password: "<your-password>"
  ssl.verification_mode: none
```

> Replace `<your-elastic-ip>` and `<your-password>` with your actual values.

### Event Logs to Collect:

```yaml
winlogbeat.event_logs:
  - name: Security
  - name: System
  - name: Application
  - name: Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational
```

---

## üöÄ Step 4 ‚Äì Start Winlogbeat

After editing the config:

```powershell
Start-Service winlogbeat
```

To verify it's running:

```powershell
Get-Service winlogbeat
```

You should now see logs arriving in Kibana under `Discover`.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Extra: Validate Sysmon Event Generation

Trigger basic activity like file creations, process executions, or PowerShell commands.

Search in Kibana Discover:
- Index: `winlogbeat-*`
- Field: `event.code`
- Common codes:
  - `1` ‚Äì Process creation
  - `3` ‚Äì Network connection
  - `11` ‚Äì File created

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

- Check logs at: `C:\Program Files\Winlogbeat\logs\winlogbeat`
- Ensure time/date on Windows is correct
- Check Windows Firewall rules
- Verify TLS and password are correct

---

## ‚úÖ Next Step

Repeat this process for all Windows systems and proceed to create custom visualizations in Kibana. Next: [04 ‚Äì Filebeat and Ubuntu logs](04-filebeat-ubuntu.md).
